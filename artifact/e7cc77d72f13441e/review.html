Note that just like in original paper, we added "-phase TEST" to command line when running Caffe tests, i.e.:

<pre>
 $ ck run program:caffe --extra_run_cmd="-phase TEST"
</pre>

This slightly changes results in comparison with executions when this extra flag is ommitted.
Also, only with this flag the difference between Caffe Intel fp32 and int8 is visible on 
Intel Xeon Platinum 8124M Processor. Hence extra validation for real inference speed may be useful!
